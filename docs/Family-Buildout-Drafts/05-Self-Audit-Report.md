## Chronological Consistency Check

### House Wilfson Timeline
| Generation | Lord | Birth | Death | Age at Death | Children Start | Reasonable? |
|------------|------|-------|-------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| 0 | Faramund | ~1722 | ~1775 | ~53 | ~1748 (age 26) | Yes |
| 1 | Colard | ~1754 | ~1812 | ~58 | ~1780 (age 26) | Yes |
| 2 | Baudric | ~1780 | ~1848 | ~68 | ~1805 (age 25) | Yes |
| 3 | Coland | ~1805 | ~1878 | ~73 | ~1830 (age 25) | Yes |
| 4 | Berin | ~1830 | ~1905 | ~75 | ~1858 (age 28) | Yes |
| 5 | Farmund | ~1858 | ~1932 | ~74 | ~1885 (age 27) | Yes |
| 6 | Colbert | ~1885 | ~1960 | ~75 | ~1915 (age 30) | Yes |
| 7 | Bauric | ~1915 | ~1985 | ~70 | ~1953 (age 38) | Late but possible |
| 8 | Jon | 1953 | living | - | ? | See note below |

**Issue Identified**: Bauric having Jon at age 38 is on the older side for this setting. Consider:
- [ ] Adjust Bauric's birth to ~1920 (Jon born when he's 33)
- [ ] Keep as is - late fatherhood happens
- [ ] Add a note that Bauric married late due to war/circumstances

### Jon Wilfson's Marriage Question

**Critical Issue**: The existing data shows:
- Jon Wilfson: b.1953, House Wilfson
- Saelis Athelmere: b.1980, listed as House Wilfson

This 27-year age gap is unusual. Possible interpretations:
1. Saelis is Jon's second (much younger) wife
2. Saelis is married to Jon's son (not Jon himself)
3. Saelis is a daughter-in-law, niece, or other relation

**Recommendation**: The draft includes both scenarios. User should clarify preferred interpretation.

### House Wilson Timeline
| Generation | Lord | Birth | Death | Age at Death | Children Start | Reasonable? |
|------------|------|-------|-------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| 0 | Lennis | ~1755 | ~1815 | ~60 | ~1778 (age 23) | Yes |
| 1 | Baudin I | ~1778 | ~1850 | ~72 | ~1802 (age 24) | Yes |
| 2 | Baudin II | ~1802 | ~1875 | ~73 | ~1830 (age 28) | Yes |
| 3 | Baudin III | ~1830 | ~1905 | ~75 | ~1858 (age 28) | Yes |
| 4 | Baudin IV | ~1858 | ~1935 | ~77 | ~1888 (age 30) | Yes |
| 5 | Baudin V | ~1888 | ~1965 | ~77 | ~1920 (age 32) | Yes |
| 6 | Baudin VI | ~1920 | ~1995 | ~75 | ~1950 (age 30) | Yes |
| 7 | Baudin VII | ~1950 | living | - | ~1978 (age 28) | Yes |
| 8 | Baudin VIII | ~1978 | living | - | ~2007 (age 29) | Yes |

**No major issues identified in Wilson timeline.**

### Bramblehall Timeline
| Generation | Lord | Birth | Death | Age at Death | Children Start | Reasonable? |
|------------|------|-------|-------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| 0 | Constann | ~1720 | ~1790 | ~70 | ~1743 (age 23) | Yes |
| 1 | Aldric | ~1743 | ~1815 | ~72 | ~1770 (age 27) | Yes |
| 2 | Constann II | ~1770 | ~1845 | ~75 | ~1798 (age 28) | Yes |
| 3 | Aldwin | ~1798 | ~1875 | ~77 | ~1828 (age 30) | Yes |
| 4 | Miric | ~1828 | ~1905 | ~77 | ~1858 (age 30) | Yes |
| 5 | Borswin | ~1858 | ~1935 | ~77 | ~1888 (age 30) | Yes |
| 6 | Aldric II | ~1888 | ~1965 | ~77 | ~1925 (age 37) | Late |
| 7 | Bors | 1925 | 1975 | 50 | ~1950 (age 25) | Yes |
| 8 | Alec | 1950 | living | - | ~1978 (age 28) | Yes |

**Issue Identified**: Aldric II having Bors at age 37 is late. Consider:
- [ ] Adjust Aldric II's birth to ~1895 (Bors born when he's 30)
- [ ] Keep as is - could be a second marriage or late first child
- [ ] Add a note that Aldric II married late

**Issue Identified**: Bors died at 50 (1975) - quite young. This is canonical and explains why Alec inherited young at 25.

## Marriage Consistency Check

### The Old Right (ended ~200 years ago = ~1826)

The drafts propose:
- Faramund Wilfson married Ermeline Wilfrey of Riverhead (~1745) - The Old Right was active
- Colard Wilfson married Giseline Wilfrey of Bramblehall (~1778) - The Old Right was active

**Consistency**: Both marriages are before ~1826, so The Old Right provisions apply. **This is correct.**

### Cross-House Marriage Verification

| Marriage | Proposed | Consistent with lore? |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| Faramund × Ermeline of Riverhead | ~1745 | Yes - The Old Right active |
| Colard × Giseline of Bramblehall | ~1778 | Yes - reconciliation noted |
| Baudric × Aveline Salter | ~1802 | Yes - outside Wilfrey, diversifying |
| Coland × Helewise Hendry | ~1828 | Yes - post-Old Right, major house |
| Berin × Celisse of Riverhead | ~1855 | Yes - traditional alliance |
| Farmund × Roseline Carlyle | ~1882 | Yes - Great House prestige |
| Colbert × Maelisse Parlin | ~1912 | Yes - minor house practical |
| Bauric × Loveline of Breakmount | ~1948 | Yes - full restoration |
| Jon × Athelmere connection | ~1978 or ~2002 | Yes - continuing close ties |

**No inconsistencies found in marriage patterns.**

## DNA Pool Diversity Check

The user specifically requested wide DNA pool connections. Checking:

### House Wilfson Marriages Into:
- House Wilfrey of Riverhead ×2
- House Wilfrey of Bramblehall ×1
- House Salter of the Scorch ×1
- House Hendry ×1
- House Carlyle ×1
- House Parlin ×1
- House Wilfrey of Breakmount ×1
- House Athelmere ×1

**Assessment**: Good diversity. Mix of Wilfrey seats, Great Houses, and minor houses.

### House Wilson Marriages Into:
- House Northmere (northern)
- House Kingsward (northern)
- House Granford (northern)
- House Croftmoor (northern)
- House Helmward (northern)
- House Blackmoor (northern)
- House Stormcrest (northern)
- House Thornwick (northern)

**Assessment**: All northern houses (fictional). This is consistent with their exile north, but creates a gap:
- [ ] Consider: Should House Wilson ever marry back into Wilfrey-connected houses?
- [ ] Keep as is - deliberate separation

### House Wilfrey of Bramblehall Marriages Into:
- House Wilfrey of Riverhead ×2
- House Wilfbole ×2
- House Wilfbark ×2
- House Wilfbauer ×2

**Assessment**: Heavy reliance on woodland cadet branches. This is noted as deliberate insularity but raises genetic diversity concerns.

## Name Consistency Check

### Names Used Multiple Times (Potential Confusion)

| Name | Occurrences | Issue? |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Aldric | Wilfson Gen 0 wife's house, Bramblehall Gen 1 & 6 | Clarify with "of Bramblehall" |
| Baudric | Wilfson Gen 2 | Unique - no issue |
| Baudin | Wilson Gens 1-8 | Intentional tradition - no issue |
| Constann | Bramblehall Gen 0 & 2 | Clarify with "II" |
| Aldwin | Bramblehall Gen 3, Wilfern current | Different houses - no issue |

**Recommendation**: Always use full identifiers (e.g., "Aldric Wilfrey of Bramblehall") to avoid confusion.

### Names From Codex Verified
All names used are either:
1. From the 3000+ name codex provided
2. Variants of canonical names (Baudric from Baudin, etc.)
3. Compounds following existing patterns (Borswin from Bors + -win suffix)

**No issues found.**

## Dignity Assignment Conflicts

Checking for overlapping tenures or impossible assignments:

### Coland Wilfson as Fosterheald (~1850-1885)
- Born: ~1805
- Age at start: ~45
- Age at end: ~80

**Issue**: Serving until age 80 is very long. Consider:
- [ ] Reduce tenure to ~1850-1875 (ages 45-70)
- [ ] Keep as is - long service possible

### Miric Wilfrey as Fosterheald (~1885-1920)
- Born: ~1828
- Age at start: ~57
- Became Lord of Bramblehall: ~1875

**Issue**: How can Miric be both Lord of Bramblehall (from ~1875) and Fosterheald (from ~1885)?

**Resolution Options**:
- [ ] Change to: Miric served as Fosterheald BEFORE becoming Lord (~1865-1875)
- [ ] Change holder to a different person
- [ ] Allow concurrent roles (lord and fosterheald)

**Recommended**: Change to pre-lordship service or select a different holder.

### Borswin Wilfrey as Fostermarshall (~1880-1915)
- Born: ~1858
- Became Lord of Bramblehall: ~1905

**Issue**: Similar to above - concurrent lord and fostering roles.

**Resolution**: He served as Fostermarshall (~1880-1905) UNTIL becoming Lord. Then someone else took over.

## Data Requiring User Clarification

### Critical Decisions Needed:

1. **Jon Wilfson's Marriage**
   - Is Saelis Athelmere his wife (27-year gap) or son's wife?
   - This affects all subsequent generation planning

2. **Raylegh's Fate**
   - Four options presented - which is canon?
   - This affects potential future storylines

3. **Constann's Heir Mechanism**
   - Option A (had sons) vs Option C (daughter married in)
   - This affects the Bramblehall lineage structure

4. **House Wilson's Seat Name**
   - "Grantholm" proposed - approve or alternative?

5. **The Wilson-Wilfrey Relationship**
   - Cordial but distant - any marriages ever?
   - This affects potential future reunification plots

---

## Biological Reasonability Check

### Marriage Ages
All proposed marriages are between ages 22-30, meeting the "married by ~24" guideline with reasonable variation.

### Childbearing Ages
- First children typically born 1-2 years after marriage
- Last children typically 10-15 years after first
- No women bearing children after age 40

**Assessment**: Biologically reasonable.

### Lifespans
- Average lifespan: ~70-77 years
- Shortest: Bors at 50 (canonical)
- Youngest death: Bertelin Wilfson at ~24 (war/accident suggested)

**Assessment**: Reasonable variation.

## Cross-Reference Issues

### People Already in Database

The following proposed characters may conflict with existing entries:
- Aldwin Wilfrey (people #285, 360) - used for Riverhead and Wilfern
- Aldric Wilfrey (people #317, 347) - used for Breakmount and Wilfern

**Recommendation**: Use generation numbers or seat specifiers consistently.

### Houses Already in Database

These fictional northern houses for Wilson marriages would need creation:
- House Northmere
- House Kingsward
- House Granford
- House Croftmoor
- House Helmward
- House Blackmoor
- House Stormcrest
- House Thornwick

**Note**: These can be created as stubs or fully fleshed out later.

## Summary of Required Corrections

### Must Fix Before Implementation:
1. Miric Wilfrey dual-role issue (Lord + Fosterheald)
2. Borswin Wilfrey dual-role issue (Lord + Fostermarshall)

### User Decisions Required:
1. Jon Wilfson's marriage interpretation
2. Raylegh's fate
3. Constann's heir mechanism
4. Wilson seat name
5. Wilson-Wilfrey relationship details

### Optional Adjustments:
1. Bauric's late fatherhood (age 38)
2. Aldric II's late fatherhood (age 37)
3. Coland Wilfson's long Fosterheald tenure
