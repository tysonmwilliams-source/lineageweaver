# House Wilson Complete Lineage Draft

**Purpose**: Build out the descendants of Lennis Wilfrey and Nivette Wilfson from their founding (~1778) to present day

**Canonical Anchors**:
- Lennis Wilfrey (codex entry #20) - Heir to Fourhearth, co-founder of House Wilson
- Nivette Wilfson (codex entry #23) - Sister of Baudin, co-founder of House Wilson
- The Founding of House Wilson (codex entry #19) - Established ~1778 (formal Crown recognition 1785)
- House Wilson (house #75) - Currently 0 members in database (EMPTY)

**Key Lore Points**:
- Fled north after Baudin's death
- Received royal grant of lands outside Wilfrey territory
- Named "Wilson" - close to "Wilfson" to claim lineage but different enough to mark independence
- House still exists 250 years later (per codex)

---

## The Northern Crown Houses (NEW - REQUIRED FIRST)

House Wilson cannot marry into families under Wilfrey Drith authority. They need a network of **Northern Crown Houses** - nobility who answer directly to the Crown, not to any Wilfrey overlord. These houses occupy the northern reaches of the kingdom, beyond traditional Wilfrey influence.

### Proposed Northern Houses (10 Total)

| House | Type | Founded | Seat | Motto | Wilson Connection |
|-------|------|---------|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Northmere** | minor | ~1150 | Merehall | "The Lake Provides" | Baudin I's wife Cereline |
| **Kingsward** | minor | ~1380 | Wardkeep | "Ever the King's Men" | Baudin II's wife Isolda |
| **Granford** | minor | ~1280 | Granford Keep | "From Good Soil, Good Folk" | Baudin III's wife Hamelina |
| **Croftmoor** | minor | ~1220 | Moorstead | "The Moor Endures" | Baudin IV's wife Aureline |
| **Helmward** | minor | ~1320 | Helm Castle | "Vigilance and Valor" | Baudin V's wife Doreline |
| **Blackmoor** | minor | ~1050 | Blackmoor Hall | "We Keep the Old Ways" | Baudin VI's wife Sireline |
| **Stormcrest** | minor | ~1400 | Cresthold | "Through Storm, Fortune" | Baudin VII's wife Eveline |
| **Thornwick** | minor | ~1920 | Thornwick Manor | "Rising Still" | Baudin VIII's wife Marelisse |
| **Ashford** | minor | ~1340 | Ashford Hall | "Steady as Stone" | Colardine's husband Rodric |
| **Fenwick** | minor | ~980 | Fenwick Keep | "Older Than Memory" | Lenniselle's husband Aldric |

**Note on House Types**: All Northern Crown Houses are classified as **minor** - they hold directly from the Crown but lack the power/territory of great houses. None are cadet branches (no parent house) or vassals (they don't serve another lord).

### House Relationships

- [ ] YES - Establish these as Crown-loyal northern houses:

```
The Northern Crown Houses form a loose network of families who:
1. Hold lands directly from the Crown (not through any Wilfrey intermediary)
2. Intermarry primarily among themselves and with House Wilson
3. Maintain cordial but distant relations with Wilfrey territory
4. Share a common identity as "northerners" distinct from the Wilfrey web

House Wilson, despite its Wilfrey blood, is accepted as part of this northern network
due to the royal grant that established them outside Wilfrey authority.
```

### All Wilson Daughters Requiring Husbands

| Gen | Daughter | Birth | Proposed Husband | His House | Marriage |
|-----|----------|-------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Colardine Wilson | ~1780 | Rodric Ashford | Ashford | ~1798 |

| 9 | Marelle Wilson | ~2010 | (too young) | - | - |

- [ ] YES - Accept these husband assignments (draws from established Northern Crown Houses)
- [ ] NO - Alternative assignments: ___________

**Note**: This creates reciprocal ties - Wilson sons marry daughters FROM these houses, Wilson daughters marry sons OF these houses. Over 250 years, House Wilson becomes deeply integrated into the Northern Crown network through marriage.

## Northern Crown Seats - Codex Entries

### Merehall (Seat of House Northmere)

```
**Merehall** is the seat of [[House Northmere]], situated on the shores of the great northern lake.

## Architecture
A sprawling, low-built hall of grey stone, more longhouse than castle. The original structure dates back centuries, with additions built as needed rather than planned. Docks extend into the lake where fishing boats tie up.

## Surroundings
The great lake dominates the landscape - cold, deep, and rich with fish. Peat bogs stretch inland, providing fuel for the north. The Northmeres have fished these waters since before anyone kept records.

## Notable Features

- The Peat Stores: Vast covered yards of drying peat
```

---

### Wardkeep (Seat of House Kingsward)

```

## Architecture
A functional military fortress rather than a lordly castle. Square towers, thick walls, and a large gatehouse spanning the road. Designed to control passage, not to impress.

## Surroundings
Wardkeep straddles the northern royal road at a natural chokepoint between hills. All traffic north or south must pass through its gates and pay its tolls.

## Notable Features
- The King's Gate: Main passage through, tolls collected here
- The Garrison Yard: Barracks for Crown soldiers
- The Road Tower: Watchtower with views for miles in each direction
```

---

### Granford Keep (Seat of House Granford)

```
**Granford Keep** is the seat of [[House Granford]], surrounded by the richest farmland in the Northern Crown Marches.

## Architecture
A practical, well-maintained keep with extensive outbuildings - barns, granaries, and cattle sheds. The Granfords invest in their farms, not their walls.

## Surroundings
Rolling fields of wheat, barley, and oats stretch to the horizon. Fat cattle graze in meadows. This is the breadbasket of the north - modest by southern standards, but vital up here.

## Notable Features
- The Great Granary: Stores enough grain to feed the northern houses through hard winters
- The Cattle Fair: Annual market drawing buyers from across the region
- The Mill: Water-powered, grinding grain for the whole district
```

---

### Moorstead (Seat of House Croftmoor)

```
**Moorstead** is the seat of [[House Croftmoor]], a remote stronghold on the edge of the northern moors.

## Architecture
A squat, weathered tower surrounded by a low wall - built to endure harsh conditions rather than siege. Outbuildings cluster close for protection from the wind.

## Surroundings
Endless moorland stretches in all directions - heather, gorse, and rough grass. Sheep dot the landscape. The wind never stops. It is beautiful in a bleak way, and deeply isolated.

## Notable Features
- The Herb Garden: Walled enclosure where moorland medicinals are cultivated
- The Sheep Folds: Stone enclosures dotting the moors for miles
- The Signal Tower: For communicating across the vast moorland distances
```

---

### Helm Castle (Seat of House Helmward)

```
**Helm Castle** is the seat of [[House Helmward]], a border fortress in the northern marches.

## Architecture
A true military castle - high walls, strong towers, and a well-designed killing ground before the gates. The Helmwards have defended this border for generations and their home reflects it.

## Surroundings
Rocky, defensible terrain on the edge of settled lands. Beyond lies wilderness - and whatever threats emerge from it. The castle watches the passes and guards the approaches.

## Notable Features
- The Armoury: One of the finest collections of weapons in the north
- The Training Yard: Where every Helmward child learns the sword
- The Watch Fires: Beacon system to warn of approaching threats
```

---

### Blackmoor Hall (Seat of House Blackmoor)

```
**Blackmoor Hall** is the seat of [[House Blackmoor]], rising from the dark peatlands of the northern bogs.

## Architecture
An ancient hall built on an island of solid ground amid the bogs. Dark stone, small windows, and a perpetual smell of peat smoke. The approach is treacherous to those who don't know the paths.

## Surroundings
Black water, dark peat, and grey mist. The bogs are dangerous but productive - peat for fuel, bog iron for smithing, eels for eating. The Blackmoors know every safe path; outsiders frequently don't.

## Notable Features
- The Bog Paths: Secret routes known only to the family and trusted servants
- The Iron Pits: Where bog iron is harvested and smelted
- The Old Shrine: Ancient stones predating the hall, still honored with offerings
```

---

### Cresthold (Seat of House Stormcrest)

```
**Cresthold** is the seat of [[House Stormcrest]], perched on cliffs overlooking the northern sea.

## Architecture
A windswept castle built into the cliff face, with a protected harbor below. Salt-stained stone and iron-bound doors that can withstand the worst storms. Ships are as important as walls here.

## Surroundings
The northern sea - grey, cold, and full of fish. Rocky coastline with hidden coves. The Stormcrests know every inlet and current along this stretch of coast.

## Notable Features
- The Harbor: Protected anchorage carved from the cliff base
- The Salt Works: Where sea water is evaporated for salt
- The Trader's Hall: Where goods from distant ports are bought and sold
```

---

### Thornwick Manor (Seat of House Thornwick)

```
**Thornwick Manor** is the seat of [[House Thornwick]], the newest of the Northern Crown Houses.

## Architecture
A comfortable manor house rather than a castle - the Thornwicks were elevated to nobility only three generations ago and their home reflects their origins as wealthy farmers. Well-built but unpretentious.

## Surroundings
Good farmland, some woodland, a village of tenants. Nothing remarkable, but solid and productive. The Thornwicks are still building their legacy.

## Notable Features
- The New Hall: Recently expanded great hall, eager to host important guests
- The Orchards: Apple and pear trees, a point of pride
- The Village: Prosperous tenants who remember when the Thornwicks were just farmers like them
```

---

### Ashford Hall (Seat of House Ashford)

```

## Architecture
A comfortable old hall, neither grand nor decrepit. The Ashfords have held this land for centuries, maintaining it without expanding it. The hall looks much as it did generations ago.

## Surroundings
Mixed farmland along a small river. An old stone bridge gives the place its name - "ash ford" from the ash trees that once lined the crossing. Pleasant, unremarkable country.

## Notable Features
- The Old Bridge: Stone crossing that has stood for centuries
- The Ash Grove: Replanted after the original trees died, maintaining tradition
- The Family Chapel: Small but ancient, with Ashford tombs dating back generations
```

---

### Fenwick Keep (Seat of House Fenwick)

```
**Fenwick Keep** is the seat of [[House Fenwick]], an ancient tower in the northern forests.

A single tall tower of old stone, surrounded by wooden outbuildings. The keep predates written records - the Fenwicks claim it was ancient when their ancestors first held it. It has been repaired but never expanded.

## Surroundings
Dense forest - oak, ash, and pine. Hunting grounds that have provided for the Fenwicks for longer than anyone remembers. The trees press close, and the keep feels hidden from the world.

## Notable Features
- The Ancient Tower: Original structure of unknown age
- The Hunting Lodge: Deep in the forest, where the lords stay during long hunts
- The Fur Store: Where pelts are prepared for trade
```

## The Wilson Tradition: "We Remember Baudin"

- [ ] YES - Establish this as canon:

```
House Wilson maintains a unique tradition: Every firstborn son is named Baudin (or a variant), honoring the fostering brother who died defending their founders' marriage.

This practice serves multiple purposes:
1. **Memory**: Ensures Baudin Wilfson is never forgotten
2. **Identity**: Distinguishes Wilsons from other houses
3. **Defiance**: A constant reminder that they exist because someone chose love over duty
4. **Healing**: Transforms a tragedy into a blessing - "Baudin gave his life so we could live"

The current Baudin Wilson VII is the eighth generation to bear the name. When asked about this, Wilsons typically respond: "We remember Baudin. We always will."
```

## Relationship with House Wilfrey (NEW)

### Historical Stance
- [ ] YES `For the first 100 years (~1776-1876), contact between House Wilson and House Wilfrey was minimal - not forbidden, but avoided by mutual unspoken agreement.`
- [ ] NO - Different approach: ___________

### Modern Relationship
- [ ] YES `In the modern era, relations are cordial but distant. There has never been a marriage between the houses - neither side has proposed one, and neither would refuse if the other did.`
- [ ] NO - Different approach: ___________

### The Unasked Question
- [ ] YES `Neither house has ever formally addressed whether House Wilson could return to the Wilfrey fold or whether reconciliation is possible. The question hangs in the air, unasked for 250 years.`
- [ ] NO - Different approach: ___________

## Proposed Codex Entries

### House Wilson (Expanded)
- [ ] YES - Create codex entry:

```
**House Wilson** was founded approximately 250 years ago by [[Lennis Wilfrey]] and [[Nivette Wilfson]] after their exile from [[House Wilfrey]] lands.

## The Name

"Wilson" was deliberately chosen to be close enough to "Wilfson" to claim the lineage while different enough to mark independence. The founders never denied their Wilfrey blood - they simply established that blood does not require submission.

## Seat

[[Grantholm]] sits on a hill in the northern reaches of the kingdom, granted by royal charter. Unlike the four seats of House Wilfrey with their distinctive resources (silver, timber, grain, trade), Grantholm's lands are primarily agricultural - sheep and grain.

## The Baudin Tradition

Every firstborn son is named Baudin, honoring [[Baudin Wilfson]] who died defending the founders' marriage. The current lord, Baudin Wilson VII, is the eighth generation to bear the name.

## Relationship with House Wilfrey

For 250 years, the two houses have maintained cordial but distant relations. There has never been a marriage between them. Neither side has proposed reconciliation; neither would refuse if the other did.

## Legacy

House Wilson exists as living proof that defiance of unjust authority - even when it costs everything - can succeed. They are neither Wilfrey nor enemy, neither kin nor stranger. They simply... are.
```

### Grantholm (New Entry)
- [ ] YES - Create codex entry:

```
**Grantholm** is the seat of [[House Wilson]], located in the Northern Crown Marches approximately two weeks' ride from [[Breakmount Castle]].

## The Northern Crown Marches

Grantholm lies within lands held directly by the Crown - territory administered by royal officers rather than any Wilfrey Drith. This placement was deliberate: the king granted Lennis and Nivette lands where they would be neighbors to loyal Crown houses (Northmere, Kingsward, Granford, etc.) rather than Wilfrey vassals.

## Origin

The castle and surrounding lands were granted by royal charter ~1778, with formal Crown recognition of House Wilson in 1785. The king welcomed [[Lennis Wilfrey]] and [[Nivette Wilfson]] after their exile, giving them a place beyond Wilfrey authority where their marriage could not be challenged.

## Architecture

Unlike the great castles of the four Wilfrey seats, Grantholm is modest but well-built. The original structure was small - little more than a fortified manor granted from an extinct line. Each generation has added to it, but the Wilsons have never sought to rival the grandeur of Breakmount or Fourhearth.

## Economy

The surrounding lands produce:
- Sheep (wool trade)
- Grain (wheat and barley)
- Some forestry

The wealth is modest but steady. House Wilson has never been rich, but they have never been poor either. Their northern neighbors - the Crown Houses - are their primary trading partners and marriage allies.

## The Grant

The name "Grantholm" reflects the royal grant that established it. Some say the founders chose the name deliberately - a constant reminder that their house exists by the king's grace, not the Wilfrey council's permission.
