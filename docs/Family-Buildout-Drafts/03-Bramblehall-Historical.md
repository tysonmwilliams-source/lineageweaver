# Bramblehall Historical Lineage Draft

**Purpose**: Build out Lord Constann's line and the succession at Bramblehall from The Scandal (~1776) to the current Bramblehall Wilfreys

**Canonical Anchors**:
- Lord Constann (codex entry #28) - Lord of Bramblehall ~1776, father of 10 daughters including Raylegh
- Raylegh (codex entry #21) - Daughter of Constann, triggered the scandal
- Bramblehall (codex entry #14) - Woodland seat of House Wilfrey
- Alec Wilfrey (people #72) - Current Drithen of Bramblehall, b.1950
- Borsham Wilfrey (people #342) - b.1951, House Wilfrey of Bramblehall
- Bors Wilfrey (people #341) - b.1925, d.1975, House Wilfrey of Bramblehall

**Key Challenge**: Lord Constann had 10 daughters but we need male heirs for succession. This needs careful handling.

---

## The Succession Problem

Per codex, Lord Constann had "ten daughters, all the most beautiful maidens in the entire land."

This presents a succession challenge - if he had only daughters, how did the Bramblehall line continue?

### Proposed Resolution Options:

- [ ] **OPTION A**: Constann also had sons, but the "ten daughters" became legendary while the sons were unremarkable
- [ ] **OPTION B**: Constann had no sons; his heir was a nephew or cousin's son who inherited
- [ ] **OPTION C**: One of the daughters married a cadet branch Wilfrey who took the Bramblehall name
- [ ] **OPTION D**: Constann's brother's line inherited

**Recommended**: Option A or C (keeps direct bloodline while explaining the legend)

## Marriage Pattern: The Woodland Tradition

- [ ] YES - Establish this as canon:

```
Unlike the other Wilfrey seats, Bramblehall lords have consistently married within the woodland cadet branches (Wilfbauer, Wilfbole, Wilfbark) rather than seeking marriages from the other seats or outside houses.

This pattern reflects Bramblehall's deliberate insularity - the woodland people keep to themselves, marry among themselves, and maintain traditions the other seats have forgotten.

The result: Bramblehall Wilfreys are more closely related to their cadet branches than any other seat. This creates both strength (unquestioning loyalty from the woodland houses) and weakness (limited genetic diversity, potential for inherited conditions).
```

---

## Raylegh's Fate (OPTIONAL ADDITION)

The codex leaves Raylegh's fate unknown. If you wish to resolve this mystery:

### Option 1: She Married the Old Knight
- [ ] YES `Raylegh married the Old Knight as originally planned after the scandal. She bore him one child before dying in childbirth as she feared. The child's fate is unknown.`
- [ ] NO - Different fate

### Option 2: She Disappeared
- [ ] YES `Raylegh fled before the wedding could take place. Her fate is unknown - perhaps she died, perhaps she found a new life under another name. The mystery remains.`
- [ ] NO - Different fate

### Option 3: She Survived and Had Children
- [ ] YES `Raylegh survived and married a minor northern lord, far from Wilfrey lands. She had children who never knew their mother's true history. Somewhere, Raylegh's descendants exist, unaware of their connection to the scandal.`
- [ ] NO - Different fate

### Option 4: Keep It Unknown
- [ ] YES `Leave Raylegh's fate deliberately unresolved - a mystery for potential future storytelling`
- [ ] NO - Resolve it now

---

## Codex Entry Drafts

### Lord Constann (Expanded)
- [ ] YES - Expand codex entry:

```
## The Ten Daughters

While Lord Constann's ten daughters became legendary for their beauty, his eldest child was actually a son - Aldric - who inherited Bramblehall upon Constann's death. History remembers the daughters because they made advantageous marriages across House Wilfrey's lands, binding Bramblehall to the other seats and cadet branches.

The daughters' marriages:
- Constance → House Wilfrey of Breakmount
- Floriselle → House Wilfrey of Fourhearth
- Giseline → House Wilfson (Colard, post-scandal reconciliation)
- Belisent → House Hendry
- Adelise → House Vespen
- Mireline → House Carlyle
- Raylegh → [fate unknown]
- Serenne → House Goff
- Dorelisse → House Parlin
- Jolissa → died young

## After the Scandal

Constann lived another 14 years after the scandal (~1776-1790), watching his daughter Giseline marry the kinslayer Colard Wilfson. Whether this was his idea or forced upon him by the council is not recorded.

He never spoke publicly of Raylegh or her fate.
```

### Bramblehall Marriage Tradition (New)
- [ ] YES - Create codex entry:

```
**The Woodland Marriage Tradition** is the pattern by which Lords of Bramblehall have consistently married within the three woodland cadet branches: [[House Wilfbauer]], [[House Wilfbole]], and [[House Wilfbark]].

## Origins

Unlike the other Wilfrey seats, Bramblehall's lords have rarely sought marriages from outside the forest region. This practice dates back centuries and reflects the woodland people's deliberate separation from the wider world.

## Advantages

- Deep loyalty from the woodland cadet branches
- Preservation of old traditions and ways
- Strong internal cohesion

## Disadvantages

- Limited genetic diversity
- Political isolation from the other seats
- Risk of inherited conditions

## Modern Era

Even today, under Lord Alec Wilfrey, the tradition continues. His wife Beraline is from House Wilfbole, and his brother Borsham married into House Wilfbark.

The other seats observe this with a mixture of respect (for maintaining tradition) and concern (for what it may mean for Bramblehall's future).
