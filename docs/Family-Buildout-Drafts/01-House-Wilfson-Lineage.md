## Generation 0: Faramund Wilfson (CANONICAL)

**Status**: Exists in codex (entry #29)

| Field | Value | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Name | Faramund Wilfson | CANONICAL |
| Titles | Lord of House Wilfson, Master of Silver Mines, Castellan of Breakmount | CANONICAL |
| Death | Peaceful, clean succession to Baudin | CANONICAL |

### Proposed Birth Year
- [ ] YES `Birth: ~1722` (died ~1775, aged ~53, giving him adult children)


### Proposed Wife (NEW)
- [ ] YES `Name: Ermeline Wilfrey`


- [ ] YES `Origin: House Wilfrey of Riverhead` (2nd daughter under The Old Right practice)


- [ ] YES `Birth: ~1726`


- [ ] YES `Death: ~1780` (outlived husband, witnessed the tragedy)


**Rationale**: Under The Old Right (ended ~200 years ago, so still active ~1750), House Wilfson as premier cadet branch had rights to marry 2nd/3rd daughters of ruling Wilfreys. A Riverhead connection adds depth. - YES THIS IS EXACTLY THE DEPTH ADDITIONS I WANT AND ACCURATE TO THE HOSTORIC CONTEXT AND NARRATIVE ELEMENTS!

### Children (3 CANONICAL + proposed additions)

| Name | Birth | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| Baudin Wilfson | ~1748 | CANONICAL | Eldest son, died ~1776 |
| Nivette Wilfson | ~1752 | CANONICAL | Daughter, founded House Wilson |
| Colard Wilfson | ~1754 | CANONICAL | Younger son, killed Baudin, became Lord |

#### Proposed Additional Child
- [ ] YES `Adelise Wilfson` (daughter, b. ~1750)


- [ ] YES `Married: Aldric Wilfrey of Breakmount` (connects to main line)


- [ ] YES `Death: ~1815` (lived long, witnessed aftermath)


**Rationale**: A daughter between Baudin and Nivette provides a marriage alliance that wasn't tainted by the scandal, maintaining some Wilfson connection to the main house.

---

## Generation 1: Colard Wilfson (CANONICAL BASE)

**Status**: Exists in codex (entry #24) but no people entry

| Field | Value | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Name | Colard Wilfson | CANONICAL |
| Event | Killed brother Baudin in duel | CANONICAL |
| Role | Became Lord, preserved House Wilfson | CANONICAL |

### Proposed Birth Year
- [ ] YES `Birth: ~1754` (made him ~22 at time of duel - young but capable warrior)


### Proposed Death Year
- [ ] YES `Death: ~1812` (aged ~58, reasonable lifespan)

## Codex Entry Drafts

### Proposed: Colard Wilfson (Expanded)

- [ ] YES - Add the following to Colard's codex entry:

```
## Life After the Duel

Following his brother's death, Colard served as Lord of House Wilfson for 36 years (~1776-1812). His marriage to Giseline of Bramblehall was seen as a gesture of reconciliation with the seat where the scandal originated.

He named his firstborn son Baudric, a variant of Baudin - a choice that divided opinions within the house. Some saw it as honoring the brother he killed; others as a constant reminder of the kinslaying.

Colard never spoke publicly of his brother's death. He performed his duties as Master of the Silver Mines and Castellan of Breakmount with grim dedication, as if proving through service that his choice had been the right one.

He died in ~1812, having passed the burden to a new generation.
```

### Proposed: Baudric Wilfson (New Entry)

- [ ] YES - Create new codex entry:

```
**Baudric Wilfson** was Lord of House Wilfson from ~1812 to ~1848, the first generation trying to move past the kinslaying that defined his father's life.

## The Weight of the Name

His name was controversial from birth - a variant of Baudin, the uncle his father had killed. Some saw this as honoring the dead; others as tempting fate. Baudric himself reportedly never discussed the matter.

## Marriage Outside

Unlike traditional Wilfson practice under The Old Right, Baudric married Aveline of House Salter of the Scorch - a deliberate choice to bring in blood from outside the Wilfrey web. This began a pattern of alternating between Wilfrey marriages and outside alliances.

## Legacy

Under Baudric's leadership, House Wilfson began its transformation from "the kinslayers" to "the loyal servants" - a reputation they would cultivate for the next two centuries.
```
