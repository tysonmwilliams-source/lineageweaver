      "content": "**The Scandal of 1776** was the defining crisis in [[House Wilfson]]'s history, resulting in the death of [[Baudin Wilfson]], the exile of [[Lennis Wilfrey]] and [[Nivette Wilfson]], the founding of [[House Wilson]], and the eternal marking of House Wilfson as kinslayers.\n\n## Timeline of Events\n\n### 1775 - Death of Lord Faramund\n[[Faramund Wilfson]], Lord of House Wilfson, died peacefully after decades of faithful service. His eldest son [[Baudin Wilfson]] inherited the titles of Lord Wilfson, Master of the Silver Mines, and Castellan of [[Breakmount Castle]].\n\n### 1776 - The Riverhead Council\nThe Lord of [[Riverhead]] died, triggering a mandatory council of all four lords. At this council, [[Lord Constann]] of [[Bramblehall]] raised the matter of his daughter [[Raylegh]]'s dishonor by [[Lennis Wilfrey]], heir to [[Fourhearth Castle]].\n\nThe council investigated and found:\n- Raylegh had disguised herself as a serving wench\n- She had deliberately sought out Lennis\n- She was pregnant and betrothed to an elderly knight\n- She had begged Lennis to marry her to escape her fate\n\nThe council's verdict: Lennis must marry Raylegh or lose his inheritance.\n\n### Baudin's Defiance\n[[Baudin Wilfson]], fostering brother to Lennis, publicly defied the council:\n- Argued no council could command a man's heart\n- Secretly arranged for his sister [[Nivette Wilfson]] to marry Lennis\n- Performed the marriage in defiance of council authority\n\n### The Kinslaying\nWhen the secret marriage was discovered:\n- All three were banished from House Wilfrey lands\n- [[Colard Wilfson]], Baudin's younger brother, challenged him to a duel\n- Colard's blade found Baudin's heart\n- Baudin died having ruled less than two years\n\n### The Aftermath\n- Lennis and Nivette fled north, eventually founding [[House Wilson]] with royal favor\n- Colard became Lord Wilfson, restoring the house to House Wilfrey's favor\n- The kinslaying purchased 250 years of continued service\n- House Wilfson became forever marked as both loyal servants and kinslayers\n\n## The Legacy\n\nThe Scandal of 1776 is taught to every generation of fosterlings as both warning and lesson:\n- The bonds of fostering can both unite and destroy\n- Loyalty to the main house is rewarded with continuity\n- Defiance, even for love, ends in death\n- Some choices leave no one whole\n\n## See Also\n- [[Baudin Wilfson]]: The brother who chose love over duty\n- [[Colard Wilfson]]: The Kinslayer who saved his house\n- [[Lennis Wilfrey]]: Founder of House Wilson\n- [[Nivette Wilfson]]: Co-founder of House Wilson\n- [[House Wilfson]]: The house that survived through kinslaying\n- [[House Wilson]]: The house born of exile",

Her marriage to Colard carried profound symbolic weight:\n\n- Bramblehall had suffered embarrassment from the scandal originating at their seat\n- By giving a daughter to the man who had restored House Wilfson's loyalty, they signaled forgiveness\n- The marriage represented House Wilfrey's acceptance that Colard had done what was necessary\n\n## Mother of the Redemption\n\nGiseline bore Colard several children, including:\n- [[Baudric Wilfson]] - heir, controversially named in memory of his slain uncle Baudin\n- [[Farelin Goff]] - second son, married into House Goff\n- [[Beraline Wilfern]] - daughter, married into House Wilfern\n\nThrough her children, she helped establish the new generation that would carry House Wilfson forward from the scandal.\n\n## The Weight of Marriage\n\nWhat was it like to be married to the man who had killed his own brother? The histories do not say. But Giseline remained with Colard for 42 years until her death in 1820, outliving him by eight years.\n\n## See Also\n- [[Colard Wilfson]]: Her husband, the Kinslayer\n- [[Baudric Wilfson]]: Her eldest son\n- [[The Scandal of 1776]]: The tragedy her marriage helped heal\n- [[Bramblehall]]: Her birth house",

His very name was controversial - a variant of [[Baudin Wilfson|Baudin]], the uncle his father had killed.\n\n## The Controversial Name\n\n[[Colard Wilfson]] named his heir Baudric - unmistakably derived from Baudin. This choice divided House Wilfson:\n\n**Those who approved:**\n- Saw it as honoring the dead\n- Believed it showed Colard's guilt and desire for redemption\n- Viewed it as keeping Baudin's memory alive\n\n**Those who disapproved:**\n- Called it tempting fate\n- Saw it as inappropriate given the kinslaying\n- Believed some names should be left to rest\n\nBaudric himself never discussed the matter publicly. The weight of his name was his to bear alone.\n\n## First Marriage Outside the Wilfrey Web\n\nBaudric married [[Aveline Wilfson|Aveline]] of [[House Salter of the Scorch]] - the first Lord Wilfson since the scandal to marry outside the Wilfrey family network. This deliberate choice brought fresh blood after the trauma and began a pattern of alternating between Wilfrey marriages and outside alliances.\n\n## Reign (1812-1848)\n\nBaudric's 36-year reign was marked by:\n- Steady, dedicated service to House Wilfrey\n- Rebuilding trust after his father's necessary but damning act\n- Establishing the pattern of alternating marriage alliances\n- Raising children who would continue the redemption\n\n## Children\n\n- [[Coland Wilfson]] - heir, name echoing Colard (his grandfather)\n- [[Ermette Wilfrey]] - daughter, married into House Wilfrey of Fourhearth\n- [[Gisel Wilfson]] - son, became Fosterreeve for 30 years\n\n## Legacy\n\nBaudric represents the second generation after the kinslaying - born in its shadow, bearing a name that constantly reminded everyone of what had been lost, yet living a life of quiet redemption through service.\n\n## See Also\n- [[Colard Wilfson]]: His father, the Kinslayer\n- [[Giseline Wilfson]]: His mother\n- [[Baudin Wilfson]]: The uncle for whom he was named\n- [[Aveline Wilfson]]: His wife\n- [[Coland Wilfson]]: His heir",

Possibilities include:\n- Devotion to his administrative duties\n- Personal choice or circumstance\n- The shadow of the family scandal making him cautious about dynasty\n\n## See Also\n- [[Baudric Wilfson]]: His father\n- [[Giseline Wilfson]]: His grandmother, namesake\n- [[The Fostering System]]: The institution he served\n- [[Fosterreeve]]: The dignity he held",

Two Wilfson men of different generations, both finding purpose in the fostering system rather than in continuing their own lines.\n\n## The Name's Echo\n\nColwin's name echoed Colard - the Kinslayer. Yet by his generation, the name could be borne by a gentle scholar, a man who taught children rather than killed brothers.
