# Fostering Dignity Historical Assignments Draft

**Purpose**: Assign historical holders to fostering positions with tenure dates, drawing from the Wilfrey web including cadet branches

**Canonical Current Holders**:
- Fosterheald: Wenton II Dunwilfrey (dignity #24)
- Fostermarshall: Edric Wilfern (dignity #25)
- Fosterbookman: VACANT (dignity #26)
- Fostersteward: Lochlann Dunwilfrey (dignity #27)
- Fosterreeve: VACANT (dignity #28)
- Fosterwarden: VACANT (dignity #29)
- Fostertallyman: VACANT (dignity #30)
- Fosterhirdward: Brandonel Dunwilfrey (dignity #31)
- Fosterhorseward: VACANT (dignity #32)
- Fosteredgemaster: VACANT (dignity #33)

**Key Principle**: These positions are held by **men** of the Wilfrey web - main house, cadet branches, and closely allied families. They are positions of trust and honor, given to those who exemplify Wilfrey values.

**Confirmed Wilfson Holders** (from implemented doc 08):
- Gisel Wilfson: Fosterreeve 1845-1875 (30 years)
- Colwin Wilfson: Fosterbookman 1870-1905 (35 years)
- Parris Wilfson: Fostersteward 1960-2000 (40 years)

**Distribution Principle**: Positions rotate among qualified families. No single cadet branch should dominate. Approximate historical share:
- House Wilfrey of Breakmount (main + Dunwilfrey): ~30-35%
- House Wilfrey of Riverhead: ~15-20%
- House Wilfern: ~15%
- House Wilfson: ~10-15%
- House Wilfrey of Bramblehall: ~10%
- House Wilfrey of Fourhearth: ~5-10%
- Allied houses: ~5%

## Historical Pattern Observations

### Family Representation
- [ ] YES - Establish this pattern:

```
The fostering positions rotate informally among:
- House Wilfrey of Breakmount (especially Dunwilfrey line)
- House Wilfson (premier cadet branch)
- House Wilfern (Breakmount cadet)
- House Wilfrey of Riverhead (financial roles)
- House Wilfrey of Bramblehall (less common due to insularity)
- House Athelmere (recent addition)
- House Wilfriver (martial roles only, despite reputation)

This rotation ensures no single family dominates while keeping positions within the trusted Wilfrey web.
```

### Gender Tradition
All fostering positions have historically been held by men. This reflects the martial and administrative nature of the roles within the broader patriarchal structure of House Wilfrey's governance.
