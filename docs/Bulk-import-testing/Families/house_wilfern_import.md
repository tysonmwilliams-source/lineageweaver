## CODEX ENTRY - House Wilfern

**Update existing Codex entry (ID: 2759) with:**

```
**House Wilfern** holds [[Drithling]] authority over Fernhold and the western foothills of [[Night Mountain]], sworn to [[House Wilfrey of Breakmount]].

## Origins

House Wilfern was founded in 1766 when **Edric Wilfrey**, second son of Lord [[Aldric Wilfrey]], was granted lands on the western face of Night Mountain. The grant recognised Edric's service and provided a cadet branch to watch the western approaches. Edric built [[Fernhold]] castle - considered "new" by castle standards at only 260 years old.

## Status and Authority

As a [[Drithling]] house, Wilfern holds cadet lord authority derived from their Wilfrey blood. They owe [[Fealty]] directly to [[House Wilfrey of Breakmount]] and participate in [[The Fostering System]], sending their heirs to be raised at [[Breakmount Castle]].

## Holdings

**Fernhold** sits on the western foothills overlooking the approaches to Night Mountain. The castle:
- Guards the western passes
- Oversees minor copper workings (not silver - that remains Breakmount's)
- Commands modest but productive forestland

Two minor houses are sworn to Wilfern:
- [[House Westholm]] - knight house on the lower slopes
- [[House Ferncross]] - landed house with forestry focus

## Character

House Wilfern is small but proud. 260 years of steady service without scandal has earned them a reputation for quiet reliability. They lack the wealth or influence of the great Wilfrey seats but maintain their dignity and honour their obligations faithfully.

## Current Members

- **Lord Leofwin Wilfern** - Seventh Lord of Wilfern
- **Lady Clarice Wilfern** (née Salomon)
- **Aldwin Wilfern** - Heir
- **Margery Wilfern** - Daughter
- **Edric Wilfern** - Youngest son, named for the founder

## See Also
- [[House Wilfrey of Breakmount]]: Overlord house
- [[House Wilfrey]]: The greater Wilfrey domain
- [[Night Mountain]]: Location of their holdings
- [[Drithling]]: Their rank under the Charter

## THE TWO MINOR SWORN HOUSES

### House Westholm
- Knight house on lower western slopes
- Founded ~1820 by a Wilfern second son
- Provides military service
- Small fortified manor
- **To create later if desired**

### House Ferncross
- Landed gentry, forestry focus
- Older local family raised to minor nobility when Wilfern established
- Provides timber, charcoal, game
- **To create later if desired**

---

## SUMMARY - What to Add

**People:** 19 new people (8 generations of Wilferns)
**Relationships:** ~25 new relationships (marriages + parent-child)
**Key Connection:** Edric Wilfern as child of Aldric (317) and Maud (318) Wilfrey

This makes the current Lord Leofwin Wilfern a distant cousin of Lord Steffan Wilfrey of Breakmount - they share Kleon as a common ancestor (Leofwin through Aldric→Edric line, Steffan through Aldric→Turelin line).
