### Testing Options

**Option A: Keep branches disconnected** (for testing fragment navigation)
- Add the Eastmount Line characters only
- Add the Thornwick Line characters only
- Don't add the Founding Generation or connecting relationships
- Result: 3 separate fragments to test navigation

**Option B: Fully connect all branches** (for a complete family tree)
- Add the Founding Generation (Brennan + Elspeth)
- Add the Connecting Ancestors (Aldric + Maud)
- Add all relationships including sibling and parent connections
- Result: One unified tree showing how the mining stock diverged from the main line

### The Wilfrey Mining Stock

All three branches share the blood of Brennan Wilfrey, Lord of Breakmount during the great silver strikes of the late 1600s:

- **Main Line** (Turelin → Steffan) - The pure blood. Aldric's descendants who stayed in politics and left the mines behind.
- **Eastmount Line** (Osric → Constance) - The mining Wilfreys. Honourable but diminished, they married merchants and overseers. Their blood mixed with lesser folk.
- **Thornwick Bastards** (Aldred → Siward) - The shameful secret. Born of a serving woman, granted a tower and put to work in the deepest shafts. Some whisper they're more commoner than noble now.
