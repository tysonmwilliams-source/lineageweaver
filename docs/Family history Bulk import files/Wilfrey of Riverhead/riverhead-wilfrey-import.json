It commands strategic views in all directions and controls a large defensible bridge spanning the river at its narrowest point.\n\n## Economic Power\n\nThe wealth of Riverhead derives from:\n- **Rich arable farmland** surrounding the castle\n- **The river itself** as a food source and trade route\n- **The bridge** controlling passage across the river\n\nRiverhead supplies half the food for House Wilfrey's entire region, with surplus for trade. This gives the Riverhead Wilfreys significant political leverage.\n\n## Political Leverage\n\nThe Riverhead Wilfreys are known for using food as political power. Their control over half the domain's food supply gives them significant influence in councils. During times of plenty, they leverage their food production for influence, sometimes straining relationships with the wider house.\n\n## Current Leadership\n\nLord [[Faraday Wilfrey]] rules Riverhead.

A veteran of many campaigns and battles, he has served [[House Wilfrey of Breakmount]] with distinction whenever called upon.\n\nHis tactical innovations and battlefield leadership have made him invaluable to the Breakmount Wilfreys, who have relied heavily on his counsel and sword arm in times of conflict.\n\n## Rewards and Recognition\n\nIn recognition of his service, Faraday has been recompensed with:\n- Extended land claims expanding Riverhead's territories\n- Prestigious marriages for his children into the Breakmount line\n\nThese rewards have cemented Riverhead's position as a vital pillar of Wilfrey power.\n\n## Family\n\nFaraday married [[Elspeth Millward]], daughter of the miller lords sworn to Riverhead. Together they have three children:\n- **[[Eldric Wilfrey]]** — heir to Riverhead\n- **[[Rosmund Wilfrey]]** — married to [[Kirk Wilfrey]] of Breakmount\n- **[[Lysara Wilfrey]]** — married to [[House Bridger]] of Longford\n\n## Breakmount Marriages\n\nThree marriages connect Riverhead to Breakmount through Faraday's influence:\n1. His brother [[Kellam Wilfrey]] married [[Bronnis Wilfrey]] of Breakmount\n2. His daughter Rosmund married Kirk Wilfrey of Breakmount\n3. His grandson [[Aldric Wilfrey]] is betrothed to [[Marta Wilfrey]] of Breakmount\n\n## Character\n\nDespite his military bearing, Faraday governs Riverhead with the same strategic thinking he brings to the battlefield. He views politics as another form of warfare, where food supplies and river access are weapons as potent as any sword.\n\n## See Also\n\n- [[House Wilfrey of Riverhead]]\n- [[Riverhead]]\n- [[The Fostering System]]"
