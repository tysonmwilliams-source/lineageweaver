The Fosterheald serves as the supreme authority over House Wilfrey's fostering tradition - a role of profound cultural significance second only to the Breakmount Mine Master in institutional importance. This appointed position carries responsibility for shaping the character, loyalties, and capabilities of every noble child entrusted to Wilfrey care.\nThe Fosterheald determines curriculum, approves all staff appointments within the fostering system, mediates disputes between fosterlings, and maintains relationships with the families who have placed children in Wilfrey wardship. They hold the authority to discipline, recommend early release from fostering, or in extreme cases, petition for a fosterling's dismissal.\nTraditionally, successful Fosterhealds have been drawn from former fosterlings themselves - individuals who experienced the system firsthand and emerged exemplifying Wilfrey values."

A fosterling showing aptitude for cartography, medicine, or theological study might receive additional tutoring at the Fosterbookman's discretion.\nThe role also encompasses maintenance of teaching materials, correspondence with outside scholars, and careful record-keeping of each fosterling's academic progress - documents which follow them throughout life."

Expenditures encompass staff wages, provisions, training equipment, educational materials, clothing allowances, and the countless incidental costs of maintaining noble youth in appropriate comfort.\nThe Fosterreeve maintains meticulous accounts separate from Breakmount's general ledgers, presenting regular reports to the Fosterheald and annual summaries to Lord Wilfrey. This financial independence ensures the fostering system remains self-sustaining and shields it from competing budgetary pressures within the wider household.\nA skilled Fosterreeve anticipates needs before they become urgent - ensuring funds exist for replacing worn training equipment, expanding library holdings, or accommodating an unexpected influx of new fosterlings."

The Fosterwarden commands dedicated watchmen, controls access to sensitive areas, and coordinates with Breakmount's broader garrison during emergencies. When fosterlings venture beyond castle walls for training exercises or excursions, the Fosterwarden arranges appropriate escort.\nDisciplinary authority represents the role's other major function. Minor infractions fall to individual staff members, but serious misconduct - fighting between fosterlings, theft, attempted escape, or behaviour bringing dishonour - comes before the Fosterwarden for investigation and judgment. They hold authority to confine fosterlings to quarters, assign punitive duties, or recommend more severe consequences to the Fosterheald.\nThe combination of security and discipline creates a figure fosterlings regard with healthy respect. A wise Fosterwarden balances firmness with fairness, understanding that today's wayward youth may become tomorrow's powerful ally."

These observations, reported to the Fosterreeve, enable proactive management.\nThe role serves as traditional training ground for those aspiring to reeve positions elsewhere. Many estates have welcomed Fostertallyman alumni into senior financial roles, their Wilfrey training considered mark of competence."

These attendants owe primary loyalty to their young masters and home houses, yet must operate within the fostering system's rules.\nCoordination challenges abound. Personal servants may clash with fostering staff over proper procedures. Attendants from rival houses might carry family grudges into their daily interactions. Some fosterlings arrive with extensive retinues while others bring minimal staff, creating awkward disparities. The Fosterhirdward navigates all of this.\nPractical responsibilities include housing assignments for attendants, establishing clear boundaries of authority, mediating disputes, and ensuring personal servants support rather than undermine the fostering system's educational goals. An attendant who helps their young lord evade training or smuggles forbidden items answers to the Fosterhirdward.\nThe role also monitors attendant welfare - these servants, often young themselves, are far from home serving masters who are themselves still children. A thoughtful Fosterhirdward recognises their vulnerability."

Training mounts require particular temperaments - patient enough for beginners yet responsive enough to teach proper technique. The Fosterhorseward selects, maintains, and eventually retires these animals, always ensuring appropriate mounts exist for fosterlings of varying ages and abilities.\nCoordination with Breakmount's main stables is essential but carefully boundaried. Fostering horses occupy dedicated stalls, and while farriers and veterinary care may be shared resources, the Fosterhorseward maintains independent authority over training schedules and horse assignments. Fosterlings who bring personal mounts from home present additional complexity - these animals must be evaluated, stabled appropriately, and integrated into training without disrupting established routines.\nThe Fosterhorseward also teaches horse care directly. Noble youth must understand grooming, feeding, tack maintenance, and the signs of illness or injury. A lord who cannot assess their own mount's condition is a lord poorly prepared for campaign or crisis."

One cannot teach the sword without understanding the sword.\nInstructional duties focus on edged weapons of all varieties. Longsword forms the foundation, but fosterlings receive exposure to shortswords, daggers, and polearms as appropriate to their age and aptitude. The Fosteredgemaster assesses each student's natural inclinations - some favour power, others speed, others precision - and shapes training accordingly while ensuring all meet baseline competency.\nArmoury management represents equally vital responsibility. The Fosteredgemaster maintains the fostering system's dedicated store of training weapons, practice armour, and protective equipment. This includes wooden wasters for beginners, blunted steel for intermediate students, and properly weighted sparring weapons for advanced training. Every item requires regular inspection - a cracked waster or loose rivet invites injury.\nSupply duties extend to coordinating with Breakmount's smiths and external suppliers. The Fosteredgemaster specifies requirements, evaluates quality, negotiates costs with the Fosterreeve's approval, and maintains inventory records. When fosterlings outgrow equipment or training demands expand, the Fosteredgemaster anticipates needs and requisitions accordingly.\nA well-run armoury reflects its master. The Fosteredgemaster who tolerates rust, disorder, or ill-maintained equipment fails not only in duty but in the example set for students. Weapon care is weapon respect, and weapon respect underpins martial discipline."
