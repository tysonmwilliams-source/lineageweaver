# Recommended Edits to Existing Codex Entries

After importing the Charter data, the following edits should be made to existing entries to integrate the new terminology and clarify the house structure.

---

## 1. House Wilfrey (Main Entry)

The existing "House Wilfrey" entry should be updated to serve as an **overview entry** rather than the primary house entry.

### Recommended Changes:

**Change the subtitle from:**
> "The Silver Lords of Breakmount"

**To:**
> "Overview of the Wilfrey Domain"

**Update the opening paragraph from:**
> **House Wilfrey** is a high-ranking noble family ruling over a massive landmass divided into four main seats of power.

**To:**
> **House Wilfrey** is the collective term for the [[Drihten]] lords who rule the Wilfrey domain in [[Estargenn]]. Four great houses bearing the Wilfrey name each hold paramount authority over their seat, bound together by [[Fealty]], blood, and [[The Fostering System]].

**Add after the opening paragraph:**
> The four seat-holding houses are:
> - [[House Wilfrey of Breakmount]] — Principal seat (overall paramountcy)
> - [[House Wilfrey of Bramblehall]] — Forest seat
> - [[House Wilfrey of Riverhead]] — River seat
> - [[House Wilfrey of Fourhearth]] — Coastal seat

**In the "Governance Structure" section, add:**
> The Wilfrey structure follows the hierarchy established in [[The Codified Charter of Driht, Ward, and Service]]:
> - Each seat-holding house exercises [[Drihten]] (paramount lord) authority
> - Cadet branches hold [[Drithling]] (cadet lord) authority
> - [[House Wilfson]] holds both [[Drithling]] status and [[Wardyn]] positions

**Update the "Cadet Branches" section header to:**
> ## Drithling Cadet Branches

**Add to tags:**
`drihten`, `charter`, `estargenn`

---

## 2. House Wilfson Entry

### Recommended Changes:

**Add a new section after "Hereditary Positions":**
> ## Status Under the Charter
>
> According to [[The Codified Charter of Driht, Ward, and Service]], House Wilfson holds a dual status:
>
> **As Drithlings:** They are [[Drithling]]s — cadet lords of the blood.
>
> **As Wardyns:** Their positions as Castellan and Master of the Silver Mines represent [[Wardyn]] authority — senior custodianship held in trust.

**Add to tags:**
`drithling`, `wardyn`, `charter`

---

## 3. Location Entries

### For Each Location, Add Reference to Ruling House:

**Breakmount Castle:**
> Breakmount Castle is the seat of [[House Wilfrey of Breakmount]], the principal [[Drihten]] house.

**Bramblehall:**
> Bramblehall is the seat of [[House Wilfrey of Bramblehall]], holding [[Drihten]] authority over the forest territories.

**Riverhead:**
> Riverhead is the seat of [[House Wilfrey of Riverhead]], holding [[Drihten]] authority over the river territories.

**Fourhearth Castle:**
> Fourhearth Castle is the seat of [[House Wilfrey of Fourhearth]], holding [[Drihten]] authority over the coastal territories.

---

## 4. Other Cadet House Entries

All cadet house entries should have:

**Add to each:**
> According to [[The Codified Charter of Driht, Ward, and Service]], this house holds [[Drithling]] (cadet lord) authority.

**Add to tags:**
`drithling`, `charter`
