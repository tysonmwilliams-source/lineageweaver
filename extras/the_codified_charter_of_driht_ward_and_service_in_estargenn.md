# The Codified Charter of Driht, Ward, and Service in the Realm of Estargenn

## Preamble

Let it be known to all within the bounds of **Estargenn**, that this Charter is set forth not to make new law, but to **set in ordered word the customs long held and long observed**. These usages have governed the rule of houses, the holding of land, and the service of sworn persons since time out of record. Where once they were kept by memory and rite, they are hereafter kept by writing and seal.

This Charter proceeds **by authority of the Crown of Estargenn**, set forth by the will of the Sovereign who bears that Crown, unnamed herein, and stands binding upon all houses, cadet lines, wards, and sworn persons owing faith within the realm.

## Article I — Of Driht and the Right to Rule

1. The word **Driht** *(a full lord, ruling by right)* shall denote authority over people, lineage, and command, whether held by blood, oath, or lawful elevation.

2. The highest such authority within a house or region shall be styled **Drihten** *(paramount lord of a house or region)*, and no person so styled shall owe civil obedience to any save the **Crown of Estargenn**, from which all paramount authority ultimately proceeds.

3. Beneath the Drihten may stand **Drithen** *(great lord)*, holding great lordship by inheritance or confirmed grant, and **Drith** *(full lord)*, holding lordship over persons and lands rightly theirs.

4. A **Drithling** *(cadet lord of the blood)* shall be one of the blood of a ruling house, bearing lawful authority derived from that house, yet not standing as its head. Such authority may be exercised over persons, households, or lesser holdings, as custom and grant allow.

5. A **Drithman** *(lord-in-service)* shall be one sworn into the ruling authority of a house, empowered to command in its name, yet holding no independent right of succession unless further raised.

6. No Driht authority may be assumed by residence alone, nor by marriage, nor by tenure of land held in trust, save where expressly granted and recorded.

## Article II — Of Wardship and the Holding of Land

1. The word **Ward** *(custodial authority, not sovereignty)* shall denote custody and stewardship, being authority exercised over land, holdings, or marches **in trust**, and not by sovereign right.

2. A **Wardyn** *(senior custodian of land)* shall be a recognised holder of land in wardship, bound to maintain, defend, and render account of that land to the Driht authority under which it is held.

3. A **Landward** *(custodial landholder)* shall keep and govern an estate or demesne granted for service or good keeping, without right to alienate or divide it beyond the terms of grant.

4. A **Holdward** *(minor estate custodian)* shall keep a manor, hall, or lesser holding, owing duty both to the Wardyn above and the Driht authority paramount.

5. A **Marchward** *(custodian of borderlands)* shall hold custody of borderlands, passes, or liminal territories, and may exercise limited martial authority as necessity demands.

6. All Ward authority is conditional, revocable, and bound to service. No Ward may lawfully claim the style or rights of Driht by wardship alone.

## Article III — Of Sir and the Honour of Service

1. The style **Sir** *(knightly honour without inherent land)* shall denote personal honour, commonly arising from knighthood, sworn service, or notable merit.

2. A Sir may hold no land, holding only their honour and oath, and such a one shall be styled simply **Sir [Name]**, sworn to their liege.

3. A Sir may be granted land to hold, whether as Landward, Holdward, or Wardyn, without thereby becoming Driht, unless expressly raised further.

4. A Sir sworn into command or governance may be styled **Sir [Name], Drithman of [House or Place]**, holding authority by service and trust.

5. The style of Sir may be borne alongside any Driht or Ward title lawfully held, and shall not be diminished thereby.

---

## Article IV — Of Tenure, Place, and Style

1. The phrase **of [Place]** shall denote lawful holding and governance of land.

2. The phrase **in [Place]** shall denote residence without rule.

3. The phrase **at [Place]** shall denote a household seat or lodging only.

4. The phrase **of the House of [Name]** shall denote blood descent without land.

5. The phrase **of the Name of [Name]** shall denote a cadet line sprung from a greater house.

6. Land held **in Fee of** another house shall remain bound in service and obedience to that house’s Driht authority.

7. Land held **in Wardship under** another shall be kept in trust and rendered back upon forfeiture, death, or lawful recall.

---

## Article V — Of Fealty and Bond

1. All Driht, Ward, and Sir authorities shall be bound by oath, whether sworn **to**, **liege to**, or **under the banner of** their lawful superior.

2. Fealty once sworn may not be set aside save by death, lawful release, or attainder.

3. Where fealty is broken, all lands, wardships, and honours derived therefrom are forfeit, pending judgment.

---

## Article VI — Of Houses and Cadency

1. A ruling house, such as **House Wilfrey of Blackmount**, shall hold its authority by Driht right, exercised by its lawful Drihten, **by sufferance and recognition of the Crown**.

2. Cadet houses sprung from it may bear Drihtling authority by blood, whether or not they hold land.

3. Where such cadet houses hold land, they shall do so **in Fee of** or **in Wardship under** the parent house, unless raised further.

4. No cadet house may claim the style of Drihten without lawful elevation and consent of Estargenn.

---

## Article VII — Of Record and Seal

1. All grants of Driht authority, Wardship, or elevated service shall be recorded in the rolls of the realm.

2. This Charter shall be sealed and set forth **by authority of the Crown of Estargenn**, and witnessed by the heads of the great houses, and shall stand until lawfully amended by that same authority.

*Thus codified, that order may endure and memory not fail.*
